# L'Ospite

>*The Host is an electronic parasite. Once it's placed near a public sculpture, The Host takes control of its resonatory body in order to reproduce messages that it gets from people around.
<br>By means of a small solenoid, every time The Host receives a bluetooth message, translates it into morse code and plays it mechanically through the sculpture that hosts it.
<br>The Hostâ€™s goal is to create temporary areas for sharing messages by decontextualizing a public object.
<br>By intervening in the public space, The Host allows those interacting with it to give voice to a mute body in the everyday space.*

>*It is necessary - in order to fully understand past and present universals, and thus to prepare for the future - to distinguish between structures, architectures, resonant organisms and their temporal manifestations.*
